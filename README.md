# Robotic_Design_Formula
The code here was made to count several problem regarding the formula to solve robotic design problem.
All code were made by using matlab to automatize the array making

<h1> DH Param Code </h1>
<p> 
DH Param code was made to solve the problem regarding the DH Parameter that need to be counted when we try to made the robot. The DH parameter needs to be assign manually but the calculation will be calculated automatically
</p>

<h1> Inverse Kinematic </h1>
<p>
The limitation of this inverse kinematic code is the code only could be run for specific model of robotic design. The other design needs further modification and needs to be adjusted to get the desired value.
</p>

<h1> Quar2Eul_ang and Eul_ang2Quar </h1>
<h2> Quar2Eul_ang </h2>
<p>
Quar2Eul_ang was made to count from the euler parameter to gain the euler angle. The euler parameter consist of 4 parameters that needs to be inserted into the program.
</p>
<h2> Eul_ang2Quar </h2>
<p>
The inverse version of the Quar2Eul_ang code. This code needs the euler angle as the input and gives the euler parameter as the result.
